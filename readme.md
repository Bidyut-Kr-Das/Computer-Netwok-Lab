> Question 1:

Write a program in c to implement Cyclic Redundancy Check for error detection and modulo
2 binary division.

- `crcEncodeDecoder.c`

> Question 2:

(a)Write a C program to compute the Hamming Distance between two
code-words (binary strings of equal length).

- `ham_dist_single.c`

> Question 3:

Write a C Program to compute the minimal Hamming Distance (d_min)
for a set of binary input strings (of same length).

- `ham_dist_min.c`

> Question 4:

Write a program in c to implement row and column parity of a 2D matrix.

- `row_col_parity.c`

> Question 5:

Write a program in c for error detection using checksum (frame length = 3).

- `check_sum.c`

> Question 6:

Write a C program to identify the class of the IP address along with the
network ID of the given IP address.
Example: Input: 120.90.10.90, Output: Class: A, etc.

- `class_full.c`

> Question 7:

Convert the dotted decimal into 32 bits IP address and check the class of the IP
address using the binary blocks (1 byte or 8 bits length each).

- `class_binary.c`

> Question 8:

Let consider a classless IPv4 IP datagram.<br>

1. Write a C program to identify the first and last IP addresses of the network.<br>

2. Write a C program to generate all the IP addresses of the network.
   Example: Input 205.16.37.39/28

- 1. `1st_lst.c`
- 2. `ip_list.c`
